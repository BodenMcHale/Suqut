## Gameplay

In Suqut, you play as an adventurer who must delve deep into the dungeon, find the Amulet of Yendor, and ascend to the surface. Along the way, you'll encounter a variety of creatures, from goblins and trolls to dragons and demons. You'll also find weapons, armor, and magical items that will help you in your quest.

But be warned: Suqut is a challenging game that punishes careless players. Your character can die from hunger, poison, traps, or combat. And when you die, your game is over - there are no saves or checkpoints.
