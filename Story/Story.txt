Beginning:

<This is displayed in the intro of the game>

Ahmed was an experienced spelunker, having explored countless caves in Arabia over the years. One day, while exploring a new area, he stumbled upon a small cave entrance that he had never seen before. He couldn't resist the temptation to explore it, so he carefully made his way inside.

As he ventured deeper into the cave, Ahmed began to feel a sense of unease. The walls seemed to be closing in on him, and the air was getting thicker. Suddenly, he heard a loud cracking noise, and before he knew it, the ground beneath him gave way, sending him tumbling into a deep pit.

When he came to, Ahmed realized that he had fallen into a deep crevice and was now trapped. He tried to climb out, but the walls were too steep and slick with moisture. The only way out was to keep moving forward.

With no other choice, Ahmed began to explore the cave system in search of a way out. The cave was dark and winding, and he had to be careful not to get lost or injured. He crawled through tight spaces, squeezed through narrow passages, and climbed over jagged rocks, all the while keeping his wits about him.

Days turned into weeks, and Ahmed's food and water supplies were dwindling. He knew he had to find a way out soon, or he would perish in the depths of the cave. 


Ending:

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Ahmed saw a glimmer of light in the distance. He rushed towards it, his heart pounding with excitement.

As he emerged from the cave, Ahmed was greeted by the bright sunlight and the warmth of the desert. He had made it out alive, and he knew that he had been lucky to do so. From that day on, he vowed never to take his love for adventure for granted and to always be prepared for the unexpected.
