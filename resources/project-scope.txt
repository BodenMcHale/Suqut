Project scope is the sum of all the work that needs to be done to complete a project. It includes the project's goals, objectives, deliverables, and timeline.

To decrease the scope of a project, you can:

    Remove features or functionality that are not essential to the project's goals.
    Reduce the project's scope by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks.
    Set realistic deadlines and expectations for the project.
    Communicate regularly with stakeholders to keep them updated on the project's progress and to get their feedback.

When decreasing the scope of a project, it is important to be careful not to remove too much functionality or features. The project should still be able to meet the needs of the users and stakeholders.

Here are some tips for decreasing the scope of a project according to the limitations of Tic-80:

    Consider the target audience. Who will be using the project? What are their needs and expectations?
    Identify the essential features. What features are absolutely necessary for the project to be successful?
    Prioritize the features. Not all features are created equal. Some features are more important than others.
    Eliminate unnecessary features. If a feature is not essential, it should be eliminated.
    Simplify the design. The simpler the design, the easier it will be to implement.
    Use existing resources. If there are existing resources that can be used, such as code or assets, then use them.
    Get feedback from users. Get feedback from users early and often. This will help you to identify any areas that need improvement.

By following these tips, you can decrease the scope of a project and make it more manageable.
